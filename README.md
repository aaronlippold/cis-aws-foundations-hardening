## Usage

### Setup your Environment  

Please see TESTING_AGAINST_AWS.md for details on how to setup the needed AWS accounts to perform testing.

Follow these instructions carefully.

1. Create an AWS account.  Make a note of the account email and root password in a secure secret storage system.
2. Create an IAM user named `test-fixture-maker`.
  * Enable programmatic access (to generate an access key)
  * Note the access key and secret key ID that are generated.
3. Create an IAM Group named `test-fixture-maker-group`.
  * Direct-attach the policy AdministratorAccess
  * Add user `test-fixture-maker` to the group

4. Set the required env variables.

- AWS Credentials
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID         - The AWS Access Key that is to be used (default: none)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY     - The AWS Secret Access Key that is to be used (default: none)
```
- TF_VAR_ prevents credentials from being populated on terrafrom logs
```
TF_VAR_aws_ssh_key_id     - The value is the name of the AWS key pair you want to use (default: none) (hide from logs)
TF_VAR_aws_access_key     - The AWS Access Key that is to be used (default: none) (hide from logs)
TF_VAR_aws_secret_key     - The AWS Secret Access Key that is to be used (default: none) (hide from logs)
```
- Infrastructure Data
```
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION        - The AWS Region you would like to use (default: us-east-1)
AWS_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TYPE - The EC2 instance type (also known as size) to use. (default: none)
SSH_SG_CIDR               - Specify an IP address in CIDR notation, a CIDR block for ssh ingress rule. (default: none)
```

### Build/Verify

Run Test kitchen

  a. `bundle exec kitchen list`  
  b. `bundle exec kitchen create cis-setup`  
  c. `bundle exec kitchen converge cis-setup`  
  d. `bundle exec kitchen verify cis-setup`  
  e. `bundle exec kitchen destroy cis-setup`  


### Known Issues

1) AWS Simple Queue Service takes a few minutes to build, so please wait a few minutes before running `kitchen verify`.

2) Known Terrafrom bug that affects Managed policy attachment shows up on a second `kitchen converge` or `kitchen destroy`. 
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/5979 .
Please converge or destroy again to get past the error.
